            I'm a computer scientist turned evolutionary biologist, focusing on applying deep learning methods to genomics. My research interests include generative modeling and population genetics. Currently, I'm exploring using transfer learning as a tool to estimate genomic variation in populations with small sample sizes.

            I'm a master's student at Ohio State University in the <a href="https://carstenslab.osu.edu">Carstens lab</a> and am exploring PhD opportunities. My goal is to contribute to the field by bridging computational and biological approaches.
