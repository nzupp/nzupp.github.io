            <p>
            I'm a Ph.D. student in the Department of Evolution, Ecology, and Organismal Biology at Ohio State University, where I work in the Carstens Lab. My research focuses on developing and applying deep learning methods to population genetics problems, with particular interest in how these computational tools can outperform traditional approaches through strategies like transfer learning and reinforcement learning.

            <p>
            I have a background in computer science, and am excited to bring that computational perspective to understanding how evolutionary processes shape genomic diversity. My current work explores how machine learning can help us make better inferences about demographic history and evolutionary dynamics from genomic data.
            </p>
            <p>
            When I'm not analyzing genomes or training models, you can find me hiking, reading, or spending time with family and friends.
